DNS.com Mobile Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application provides basic access to the capabilities of the DNS.com web
site from a simplified Android application. The app provides access to all
functions which are currently available via the DNS.com API.

https://github.com/dnsdotcom/API_DOC

Basic features include:

View/Delete/Modify/Create domains and domain groups
View/Delete/Modify/Create hosts
View/Delete/Modify/Create resource records
View/Delete/Modify/Create geo-location groups

In addition to the DNS.com access, we have included some tools to assist the user
in troubleshooting DNS issues. The tools will allow you to perform:

* WHOIS lookups
* DNS queries against specific DNS servers
* Geo-Location testing (By implementing the EDNS0 extension and specifying a
  source IP address)
* Perform traceroutes to a given IP address

The results of all tests can be sent via e-mail in case you want to send a support
request to DNS.com or others.
